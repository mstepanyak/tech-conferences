# List of my favorite software engineering conferences and events

Conferences, powerfully, offer the ability to gather with like-minded individuals in a room, where ideas that might never have come to light have the breathing room to be shared. The following are some significant reasons why you should attend/watch  conferences:
**learn** and develop your skills, **boost** your network, **exchange** views on shared challenges, **acquire** the latest industry knowledge, **have fun** and travel. <br>
